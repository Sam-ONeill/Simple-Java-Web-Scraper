# Java WebFetch
This program takes a URL and searches for all valid HTTP/HTTPS links on that page then, navigates to the respective pages and downloads all elements. The resulting HTML files are saved in the same directory as the Java program.

I created this program to gain deeper insight into programming HTTP requests through Java and thought building a simple scraper would be an excellent way to showcase what I had learned.

## Technologies Used
This code is an example use case of the Apache HttpComponents package.

## To Run 
To run the program, replace the default URL with one of your choice, compile and run.
